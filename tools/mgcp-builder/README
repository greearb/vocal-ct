Todo:


add API for the networking (who do you pass a port and IP address to)?


agent/gateway object has a sendto method -- which sends the object to
that device.


threading model and interactions for the networking model.


event handling



DONE: 	think about how events are handled in the sense of how to they
        contain other events (e.g. what are the relationships between events?)


endpoints and connections -- no classes -- just message based at this
level.


would a gateway connect to more than one agent?


 -- look at switchover


sample code.


Need support for (a) the fact that Notify originates on the Mg, not
Mgc, side, as well as the dual nature of DeleteConnection .


add stuff for restartInProgress


DONE: add the ability to comment the configuration files (using # on the
      first column)
