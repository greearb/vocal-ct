INTRODUCTION 
====================================================================
ldap2vocaluser is an export tool that allows you to export user
information from an LDAP server, into the Vocal user database format.
ldap2vocaluser expects the following 4 LDAP attributes be present 
in your LDAP schema:

   vocalPhonenumber
   vocalIP
   vocalFNA
   vocalCFB

If these attributes are not present in your schema, the tool will 
still work,  but it will place 'fillers' in these fields when writing
the user xml files. For direction on how to add the above attributes
to your LDAP server, refer to the "USING THE SOFTWARE:" section of 
this document.

====================================================================
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE 
====================================================================
ldap2vocaluser - Executable, can be placed in any executable
  directory.  Normally resides in /usr/local/vocal/tools

vocal-schema.conf - LDAP Schema additions that can be used to expand 
  your schema to use the Vocal LDAP attributes.  Put this file in 
  your LDAP server's config directory (wherever your slapd.conf is)

====================================================================
NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE 
====================================================================
None

====================================================================
BUG FIXES 
====================================================================
None, First release

====================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
====================================================================
Running the tool without a binddn and bindpw will normally only 
give you the first 500 users.  To export an entire LDAP of over
500 users, use the binddn and bindpw options.

====================================================================
GETTING STARTED
====================================================================
HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Tested on Linux Redhat 6.2 with the following kernels:
2.2.14, 2.2.16, 2.2.18.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Copy the ldap2vocaluser binary to /usr/local/vocal/tools

BUILD OR COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS:
In order to build ldap2vocaluser, your must have the LDAP development
API libraries/headers (ldap.h/lber.h) installed.  The rpm package name
for this API is openldap-devel.  The current build is tested with 
version 1.2.9-6 of openldap-devel.  You may also download the LDAP 
API source from www.openldap.org.  After installing the LDAP API, 
you can build the software using the existing Makefile.

USING THE SOFTWARE:
Usage: ldap2vocaluser -h ldaphost 
                      -b basedn 
                      -d output_directory 
                     [-p ldap_port] 
                     [-k datastore hash key]
                     [-D binddn -w password] 

-h ldaphost is the hostname of the LDAP server you're going to 
   export data from.
   
-b basedn is the Base Distinguished Name of the LDAP tree you're going
   to export data from.
   
-d output_directory is the local filesystem you want the LDAP user
   data to be exported to.  This directory is always going to be the
   vocal provisioning user directory.  The user directory is normally
   in /usr/local/vocal/provisioning_data

-p ldap_port is optional, default is 389.

-k datastore hash key argument is for compatibilty with the vocal 
   provisioning server and can largely be ignored.  The default hash
   key value is 6.

-D binddn is what you what to bind to your LDAP server as

-w password is the LDAP password for the given binddn.  The binddn and 
   password are optional. Use these opotions if you'd like to change 
   any LDAP server options. In some cases, with large LDAP databases, 
   you will need to change the server option called 'LDAP_OPT_SIZELIMIT'.  
   This is defaulted to 500 on most LDAP servers.  Binding as Directory 
   Manager will assume you want to search the entire database, and the 
   search size limit will be set to infinite. 

Adding the Vocal Schema to your LDAP server:

In order to take advantage of this tool, you will need to add the
vocal attributes to your existing ldap server.  If you're using
openldap, you can add vocal attributes to your schema as follows:
1) Shutdown your LDAP server (/etc/rc.d/init.d/ldap stop)
2) Copy the vocal-schema.conf file to your LDAP config directory.
   This directory is normally in /etc/openldap
3) Edit your slapd.conf and add the following line under your existing
   'include' lines:
   include /etc/openldap/vocal-schema.conf
4) Start your LDAP server (/etc/rc.d/init.d/ldap start)

====================================================================
SOURCE CODE INFORMATION
====================================================================
ldap2vocaluser expects the following 4 LDAP attributes be present 
in your LDAP schema:

   vocalPhonenumber
   vocalIP
   vocalFNA
   vocalCFB

If these attributes are not present in your schema, the tool will 
still work,  but it will place 'fillers' in these fields when writing
the user xml files.  These fillers can be changed by changing the 
*_NOT_IN_LDAP static constants in the source files.
