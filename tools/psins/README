Readme for psins.pl

Usage:

This script allows you to read data from the provisioning library.
It's written in perl.

this script requires the psinslib.pm library, which is in
provisioning/web .  You need to copy that file somewhere into the
library search path for perl (the best location is this directory).

Note: The script is not supported/tested in 1.5.0 release.
