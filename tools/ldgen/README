This directory contains scripts to:

genFeatures.pl - generate feature cpl files 
genUsers.pl    - generate user account xml files
ranLoadGen.pl  - perl driver of start-uaxterms srcipt,
                 it randomly selects a pair of call ids given a
                 range, and fix up the ua.cfg files in the call
                 and rec directories respectively, then start
                 up ua for x (user provided parameters) times,
                 then repeat the select user ids, fix up cfg
                 files and run ua's again.

Generate users:
--------------

   This script will generate a large number of users and put them in
the correct directories within the provisioning data. It starts at
the specified start user # and increments from there.

 ../vocal/tools/ldgen/genPutUsers.pl

 usage:  ./genPutUsers.pl <start user #> <number of users>

The script relies upon a c++ executable called PutMultipleFiles.
In order to use this you will need to do the following:
  ../vocal/provisioning/conversion/make
Then copy the resulting executable into the directory where you
want to run genPutUsers.
  Need to create a file called 'tplate' which is an xml file that
will be used as the template for the generated users. It is best
to generate a valid one via the GUI and then copy the file over.

Note: You may want to modify genPutUsers.pl if your provisioning data
is not in: /usr/local/vocal/provisioning_data

Once you have the users generated you can begin registering them.
