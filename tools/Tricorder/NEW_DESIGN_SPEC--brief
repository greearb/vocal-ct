Phase 1		Completed Friday evening, June 30

	- Read messages from an ipgrab log
	- Display servers
	- Display messages between servers (labeled arrows)
	- Scroll properly when there are too many messages to fit in
		the display area

Phase 2		Completed Tuesday evening, August 8;
	        important bug fix Wednesday afternoon, August 9

	- Discover servers dynamically while parsing the log, so that no
          user interaction is required to work with different combinations
          of servers

	- Support printing to Postscript.

	- Test parsing against different call scenarios to ensure that it
	  is general and robust.  (Completed Friday, August 11.)

Phase 3		Completed Saturday evening, August 25
		(We can move this to Monday or Friday if you prefer.
		I would have said Friday, but I wanted to allow an
		extra day because of our vacation.

	- Display entire SIP messages (full requests plus headers)
		in pop-up balloons when the user moves the pointer
		over the call-flow arrows

Phase 4		Deadline:  Thursday, August 31 at midnight
		(amended 8/28/2000 to Saturday, September 2 at midnight)

	- Add functionality to attach to a running ipgrab

	- Add a GUI field for the actual ipgrab command to run

	- Add a "clear" button to free the message data structures
	  and clear the canvas, so multiple calls can be made in one
	  session

	- Add a "insert break" button, allowing users to visually
	  separate multiple calls within a single session, without
	  using the "clear" button.

Phase 5   Deadline:  Thursday, September 7, 2000 at midnight
        - Add functionality to split Postscript output into pages
        - Add intelligence for splitting messages cleanly (e.g.
          keeping all legs of a relayed 200 response on one page,
          even if that means foreshortening the page)
        - Add ability to translate server IPs / port numbers
          to a logical server name (e.g. "UA Marshal").
          (Actually, I wrote this code a while ago, but it needs
          to be tested and debugged.)

Phase 6   Deadline:  Saturday, September 16, 2000 at midnight
        - Add ability to read from multiple ipgrabs on different machines,
          collate them, and display them in a single canvas


Phase 7

	- Debug batch mode, set up CGI interface.

Phase 8 (This one just occurred to me.  Do you think it would be
	worthwhile?)

	- Port to Windows.  (Theoretically any Perl-Tk program should run
	on Windows, but I will doubtless need to eliminate Unixisms like
	paths with slashes in them.)

Phase 9 (perhaps to be canceled?)

	- Allow users to change servers' order on the screen by dragging
	- Add an option to save the order of servers in a file
	- Add an option to restore the order of servers from a file
