====================================================================
RADIUS README
====================================================================
RADIUS
Alpha release
September 20001

====================================================================
INTRODUCTION
====================================================================
The vocal/radius directory contains the C++ source for RFC2865 and
RFC2866 implementation.

RADIUS messages supported:
1. Access-Request
2. Access-Accept
3. Access-Reject
4. Accounting Request
5. Accounting Response

The RadiusAttribute class is designed to be generic, so attriubtes
conforming to the format that is specified in RFC2865 are supported.
However, only a portion of the attributes in RFC2865 and RFC2866
are interpreted for debug printing.

This implementation is designed to be a component that can be use
in a Authorization, Authentication and Accounting application.
Therefore, the AAA "transceiver" is not implemented here so that
RADIUS can be replaced by another protocol if needed.

The test sub-directory contains three test programs.
1. radiusTest - unit test cases using vocal/util/Verify.hxx
2. radiusClient - simulates a RADIUS client that sends RADIUS requests
3. radiusServer - simulates a RADIUS server that sends RADIUS responses
                  upon receiving requests from clients

====================================================================
NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS IN THIS RELEASE
====================================================================

This is an Alpha release. More features and enhancements are expected
later on.

====================================================================
BUG FIXES
====================================================================
This section lists fixed bugs in future releases.

====================================================================
GETTING STARTED
====================================================================

This code will compile and run on these operating systems:
- Linux Red Hat 6.2 and 7.1
- Solaris 2.8 with Forte 6U1

To compile the RADIUS code from vocal/radius/, type:
   make

To compile the test programs from vocal/radius/test/, type:
   cd test
   make

To compile both the RADIUS code and test programs from .../vocal/,
type:
   make radius
   make radius_test

Try out the test programs in .../vocal/radius/test/.

====================================================================
