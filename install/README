This is the README for installing the VOCAL system.

 This README is obsolete.  It is included for historical purposes only.

Before you begin:
-----------------
You need to have the following packages installed for
the VOCAL system to run:
 1. Java Runtime Environment ver. 1.2.2
 2. Secure Shell ver. 1.2.27-6 or higher (or rsh)
 3. Java Plugin for linux
 4. Open LDAP ver. 1.2.9-6
 5. Apache Webserver ver. 1.3.12-2

You can download the dependency tar ball, which contains 
all the above packages. Otherwise, you could download and 
install each of the required packages individually.

 1. Create a trusted root:
 --------------------------
 The next step is to set up a trusted root.
 This should be done for ssh, rsh or ssh2. This is required
 to run deploy and bring up the VOCAL system.
  a) RSH:
  --------
    1. Edit the /root/.rhosts file and add to it, the name of 
       the host from which you are going to install the VOCAL
       system. (You should add an entry for the complete name
       and for each of the aliases).
       For eg:
       If the machine from which you are going to install the 
       VOCAL software is switch1.vocal.com and it's alias is 
       switch1, the .rhosts file would look like this:
       switch1.vocal.com
       switch1
    2. Repeat step 1 for the /etc/hosts.equiv file.
    3. rsh into the hosts.

  b) SSH :
  --------
    1. Run ssh-keygen.
    2. Accept all the defaults by pressing enter till it's done.
    3. Copy /root/.ssh/identity.pub to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.
    4. Restart the ssh daemon by typing:
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/sshd restart
    5. ssh into the hosts to test this out. Please ssh into the 
       machines with both the complete name and the alias. For eg:
       If you are deploying onto switch1.vocal.com and it's alias
       is switch1, please ssh into the machine twice - once into
       switch1.vocal.com and next into switch1.

  c) SSH2 :
  --------	
    1. Run ssh-keygen2.
    2. Accept all the defaults by pressing enter till it's done.
    3. Copy /root/.ssh2/identity.pub to /root/.ssh2/authorized_keys.
    4. Restart the ssh daemon by typing:
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/sshd2 restart
    5. ssh into the hosts to test this out. Please ssh into the 
       machines with both the complete name and the alias. For eg:
       If you are deploying onto switch1.vocal.com and it's alias
       is switch1, please ssh into the machine twice - once into
       switch1.vocal.com and next into switch1.

 2. Configure Apache :
 ---------------------
 If you chose to install apache from the INSTALL script, you have 
 to configure it.
 If you already had apache, please check to make sure that it is 
 configured correct.

  a) To configure apache : 
  ------------------------
   (i) edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  (ii) Search for ServerName
 (iii) Specify the ServerName by changing the line that
       looks like:
       #ServerName localhost
       by replacing localhost with your hostname, and remove the
       '#'.
       (To find out your hostname, type hostname at the prompt)

 3. jdk :
 --------
 Create a softlink "/usr/jdk" to point to the directory
 where you have installed jdk or jre. To do this use the ln 
 command :
   ln -s <jdk-or-jre-directory> /usr/jdk

 4. Run deploy : 
 ---------------
 "deploy" is used to install the VOCAL system on either
 multi-host systems or an all-in-one system (a single host
 system).

  a) Requirements:
  ----------------
   1. deploy should be run as root.

  b) Running deploy for a single-host system (all-in-one):
  --------------------------------------------------------
  If you want to install an all-in-one system (running the entire 
  VOCAL system on a single host) :
    1. cd into the bin directory.
    2. Edit the install.cfg file in the bin directory.
    3. Run deploy with the -a switch as follows:
        ./deploy -a
  
  c) Running deploy for a multi-host system:
  -------------------------------------------
  To run deploy for a multi-host system:
 
    1. Edit the hosts file.
       The hosts file contains :
       i) RemoteLoginProtocol which specifies the protocol to use.
          (accepted protocols are ssh, rsh or ssh2). 
      ii) A list of the hostnames, (one host per line) onto which 
          the VOCAL system should be deployed.
    2. If you have more than one PSTN Gateway, create a Gateways file.
       (similar to the hosts file).
    3. cd into the bin directory and run deploy by typing:
        ./deploy
