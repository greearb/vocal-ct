PURPOSE

This document is to provide a simple, high level description of RTSP server
design and implementation.


KEY FEATURES

The RTSP Server uses the RTSP Stack to receive RTSP messages.  The server 
process these message through a state machine and handles them apporiatly.  
Sessions are managed by a RtspSessionManager.  The RtspRtpProcess handles the 
RTP traffic, both playing and recording.  RtspFileHandler and RtspFile handles 
reading and writing to the audio file and sdp file.

The RTSP Server supports *.au, *.wav, *.rap, and *.rtp file formats.  *.rtp is
a RTSP server only format which is used to record unknown media formats.  The 
optional sdp file holds the sdp block describing the audio files.


LIMITATION

* No UDP support

* No mulitcast or boardcast support.


DATA STRUCTURES

RtspSession holds all the information about a RTSP Client's interaction with 
the server.

RtspFile is a base class for various file formats.


THREAD USAGE

Thread One:  Receives new TCP connections and process current TCP connections 
into RTSP messages

Thread Two:  Process new RTSP messages into a state machine.  Responds to the 
messages.  (RtspServer)

Thread Three:  Process playing RTP traffic.  (RtspRtpProcessor.hxx)

Thread Four:  Process recording RTP traffic.  (RtspRtpProcessor.hxx)
