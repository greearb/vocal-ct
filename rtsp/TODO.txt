BUGS:

* last few packets of rtp stream lost, or miscalculations somewhere
* Windows Media Player doesn't display correct size of *.au file



TODO:

* add rtcp ports in creating rtp session

* RTCP BYE needs to be handled for RTSP
RTSP spec doesn't provide a mechanism through which a server could
indicate the client about the end of a playout. The way currently it's
handled is that the server indicates the duration of a presentation as
part of session setup(actually part of DESCRIBE response). Once the play
has started, the client starts a timer and at the expiry of timer it's
assumed that the play is over - which is true in almost all cases. But
there are cases where server doesn't know the duration of a play
ahead(during session setup). For eg., TTS(Text to speech) environment
the server doesn't know the actual duration of playout. One way to
handle this is to send the client max duration(say 3 min or so) and once
the play is done, the server would be sending RTCP BYE.  Remember, RTSP
uses RTP/RTCP for play out(just like voice call). When the RTCP bye is
received, the client could go ahead and close the session.



PENDING CODE REVIEW COMMENTS:

* OpPlay, use internal pause events.  Instead of static process functions

* RtspServer, pass around the sessionId instead of the state
    remove state information form RtspServer
