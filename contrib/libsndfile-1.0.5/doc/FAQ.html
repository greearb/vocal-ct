<H2><BR><B>Q1 : On Linux, sf_open returns weird info about files. Why?</B></H2>
<P>
	This simple call to sf_open :
</P>
<PRE>
        file = sf_open (filename, SFM_READ, &amp;sfinfo) ;

        printf ("srate    : %d\n", sfinfo.samplerate) ;
        printf ("frames   : %d\n", sfinfo.frames) ;
        printf ("channels : %d\n", sfinfo.channels) ;
        printf ("format   : %d\n", sfinfo.format) ;
        printf ("sections : %d\n", sfinfo.sections);
        printf ("seekable : %d\n", sfinfo.seekable) ;
</PRE>
<P>
returns this weird info:
</P>
<PRE>
        srate     : 0
        frames    : 1445760
        channels  : 44100
        format    : 2
        sections  : 65538
        seekable  : 1

</PRE>
<H2><B>Answer</B></H2>
<P>
This is only a problem on Linux and other 32 bit OSes (possibly 32 bit Solaris)
which require special compiler command line options to allow access to files
greater than 2 Gig in size.
<A HREF="pkgconfig.html">These instructions</A> should show you a way around this
problem.
</P>

<H2><BR><B>Q2 : In version 0 the SF_INFO struct had a pcmbitwidth field
		but version 1 does not. Why?</B></H2>
<P>
	This was dropped for a number of reasons:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI> pcmbitwidth makes little sense on compressed or floating point formats
	<LI> with the new API you really don't need to know it
</UL>
<P>
As documented
    <A HREF="http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/api.html#note1">here</A>
there is now a well defined behaviour which ensures that no matter what the
bit width of the source file, the scaling always does something sensible.
This makes it safe to read 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit PCM files using sf_read_short()
and always have the optimal behaviour.
</P>

<H2><BR><B>Q3 : Compiling is really slow on MacOSX. Why?</B></H2>
<P>
When you configure and compile libsndfile, it uses the Bourne shell for a number
of tasks (ie configure script and libtool).
However, Apple has decided to ship their system with a really crappy Bourne shell.
</P>
<P>
To fix this I suggest that you install the GNU Bash shell, rename /bin/sh to
/bin/sh.old and make a softlink from /bin/sh to the bash shell.
Bash is designed to behave as a Bourne shell when is is called as /bin/sh.
</P>
<P>
When I did this on my iBook running MacOSX, compile times dropped from 13 mintes to 3
minutes.
</P>

<H2><BR><B>Q4 : When trying to compile libsndfile on Solaris I get a "bad
		substitution" error on linking. Why?</B></H2>
<P>
It seems that the Solaris Bourne shell disagrees with GNU libtool.
</P>

/bin/sh.old and make a softlink from /bin/sh to the bash shell.

<H2><BR><B>Q5 : Why doesn't libsndfile do interleaving/de-interleaving?</B></H2>
<P>
This problem is bigger than it may seem at first.
</P>
<P>
For a stereo file, it a pretty safe bet that a simple interleaving/de-interleaving
could satisfy most users.
However, for file with more than 2 channels this is unlikely to be the case.
If the user has a 4 channel file and want to play that file on a stereo output 
sound card they either want the fitst two channels or they want some mixed combination 
of the 4 channels.
</P>
<P>
When you add more channels, the combinations grow exponentially and it becomes
increasingly difficult to cover even a sensible subset of the possible combinations.
On top of that, coding any one style of interleaver/de-interleaver is trivial, while
coding one that can cover all combinations is far from trivial.
This means that this feature will not be added any time soon.
</P>

<H2><BR><B>Q6 : What's the best format for storing temporary files?</B></H2>

<P>
When you want to store temporary data there are a number of requirements;
</P>
<UL>
	<LI> A simple, easy to parse header.
	<LI> The format must provide the fastest possible read and write rates (ie
		avoid conversions and encoding/decoding).
	<LI> The file format must be reasonably common and playable by most players.
	<LI> Able to store data in either endian-ness.
</UL>
<P>
The format which best means these requirements is AU, which allows data to be
stored in any one of short, int, float and double (among others).
</P>
<P>
For instance, if an application uses float data internally, it temporary files
should use a format of (SF_ENDIAN_CPU | SF_FORMAT_AU | SF_FORMAT_FLOAT) which
will store big endian float data in big endian CPUs and little float endian data
on little endian CPUs.
Reading and writing this format will not require any conversions or byte swapping
regardless of the host CPU.
</P>

<H2><BR><B>Q7 : On Linux/Unix/MaxOSX, what's the best way of detecting the presence
	of libsndfile using autoconf?</B></H2>

<P>
libsndfile uses the pkg-config (man pkg-config) method of registering itself with the
host system.
The best way of detecting its presence is using something like this in configure.ac
(or configure.in):
</P>
<PRE>
        PKG_CHECK_MODULES(SNDFILE, sndfile >= 1.0.2, ac_cv_sndfile=1, ac_cv_sndfile=0)

        AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED([HAVE_SNDFILE],${ac_cv_sndfile},
			[Set to 1 if you have libsndfile.])

        AC_SUBST(SNDFILE_CFLAGS)
        AC_SUBST(SNDFILE_LIBS)
</PRE>
<P>
This will automatically set the <B>SNDFILE_CFLAGS</B> and <B>SNDFILE_LIBS</B>
variables which can be used in Makefile.am like this:
</P>
<PRE>
        SNDFILE_CFLAGS = @SNDFILE_CFLAGS@
        SNDFILE_LIBS = @SNDFILE_LIBS@
</PRE>
<P>
If you install libsndfile from source, you will probably need to set the
<B>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</B> environment variableas suggested at the end of the
libsndfile configure process. For instance on my system I get this:
</P>
<PRE>
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Configuration Complete =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

          Configuration summary :

            Version : ..................... 1.0.5
            Experimental code : ........... no

          Tools :

            Compiler is GCC : ............. yes
            GCC major version : ........... 2

            ** This compiler version allows applications to write
            ** to static strings within the library.
            ** Compile with GCC version 3.X to avoid this problem.

          Installation directories :

            Library directory : ........... /usr/local/lib
            Program directory : ........... /usr/local/bin
            Pkgconfig directory : ......... /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

        Compiling some other packages against libsndfile may require
        the addition of "/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig" to the
        PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

<H2><BR><B>Q8 : Q8 : How about adding the ability to write/read sound files to/from
	memory buffers?</B></H2>

<P>
I have a had a number of requests like this over the last 18 months.
As yet, no-one has been able to justify why this is a good idea and why this
cannot be done a different way.
</P>
<P>
One example of different way is temproary files stored on a temporary file
systems (ie tmpfs on both Linux and Solaris).
These require not changes to libsndfile, no extra code in libsndfile, achieve
exactly what is required and work now.
