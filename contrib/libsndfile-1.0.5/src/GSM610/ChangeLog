	* *.[ch]
	Removed all pre-ANSI prototype kludges. Removed proto.h and unproto.h. 
	Started work on making GSM 6.10 files seekable. Currently they are not.

    * code.c private.h
	Function Gsm_Coder () used a statically defined array. This was obviously
	not re-entrant so moved it to struct gsm_state.
