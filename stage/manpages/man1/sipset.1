.SH NAME
sipset   , gua    \- sample User Agent  
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsipset\fR
.PP
\fBgua\fR
{\fB-f config_file\fR}
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a sample User Agent that uses the Vovida SIP stack\&.
.PP
Use sipset to get a graphical user interface\&. Use gua to get a
command-line interface\&.
.SH SIPSET STARTUP
Main Window
.PP
When you start up the User Agent, you will see the main screen with
a toolbar at the top, and a single entry field with a button labelled
"Talk"\&. Once some basic configuration parameters have been
entered, you can make a phone call by entering a SIP URI or phone number
in the entry field and clicking on the Talk button\&.
.PP
.RS 
\fBTip: \fR
.PP
For peer-peer call without a proxy/registrar, just type in the
address of the peer peer@host:port in the single entry field\&. By default
SipSet listens on port 5060 for SIP messages\&. If port 5060 is taken , it
tries to take the next port in increments of 1 ( exception is 5061 that 
is reserved for TLS)\&. So if fails to use 5060 will try 5062,5063\&.\&. and 
so on\&. The port used by the SipSet is logged in the
log file and can be looked into using "View" menu option\&. For example 
if SipSet user 1000 and 1001 are running at IP1
and IP2 respectively and SipSet port is 5062, to make a call from 1000
to 1001, one will type 1001@IP2:5062 and press the talk button\&.
.RE
.PP
In the lower right-hand corner of the main screen there is an icon
that lets you know whether you are registered with a SIP Proxy Server\&. A
red X indicates that you are not registered and a green check indicates
that you are registered\&.
.PP
At the bottom of the main screen is a status message field\&. This
will show you messages indicating the current status of your call\&.
.SH BASIC CONFIGURATION
Basic Configuration Window
.PP
From the toolbar, select Settings/Basic Configuration\&. A dialog
appears with the following parameters: 
.TP 
User  Name
Your phone number\&. This is a required field\&. If
you are routing your calls through VOCAL, this number must be in your
VOCAL provisioning\&. Note that 1000 and 1001 are provisioned in the
allinone as samples, so you could start by setting User Name to one of
those\&.

.RS 
\fBTip: \fR
.PP
If using SipSet for peer-peer call, just need to
set up the user name and skip rest of the basic/advanced configuration\&.
.RE
.TP 
SIP  Proxy Server
the IP address of your SIP Proxy\&. In
most cases you will want to route your calls through a SIP Proxy and also
register to receive calls through that proxy\&. To make calls through the
VOCAL allinone system, set this field to the IP address of the machine
running the allinone\&.

.RS 
\fBTip: \fR
.PP
The User Agent will attempt to
register at the address given in the SIP Proxy field\&. If that field is
left blank, the User Agent will not attempt to register\&. If you are not
registered, you can still make phone calls directly to another SIP phone\&.
If you are using the SipSet to make peer-peer call without a
proxy/registrar
.RE
.TP 
Password
for
SIP Proxy authentication\&. This field is only required if your proxy
requires authentication\&. By default, authentication is turned off in a
VOCAL allinone installation
.SH ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
Advanced Configuration Window
.PP
From the toolbar, select Settings/Advanced Configuration\&. A dialog
appears with the following parameters\&. Note that all of these settings are
optional\&. 
.TP 
Display Name
This
field defaults to User Name\&. You may change the Display Name to show a
different identity when you make a call\&.
.TP 
SIP  Transport
either UDP or TCP\&.
.TP 
Register  From
IP of machine this user agent is registering
from\&.
.TP 
Registrar
IP
of registrar, if different from SIP Proxy\&.
.TP 
Expires
Time
(in seconds) until registration expires\&. The User Agent will attempt to
re-register after this time has elapsed\&.
.TP 
Sound  Device
Location of sound card\&.
.TP 
Min  RTP Port
The lowest port number used by RTP\&.
.TP 
Max  RTP Port
The highest port number used by RTP\&.
.TP 
Log  Filename
Name of the log that the User Agent will
log messages to\&.

.RS 
\fBTip: \fR
.PP
This file must be writable by the User
Agent or the program will not run\&.
.RE
.TP 
Log  Level
Verbosity of log messages\&.

.RS 
\fBTip: \fR
.PP
To
debug the User Agent, set this to LOG_DEBUG_STACK, which is the highest
verbosity\&.
.RE
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
All configuration parameters are stored in a file called
"gua\&.cfg" which is located in the directory $HOME/\&.sipset, created
the first time sipset runs\&. The first time you run sipset, all
configuration parameters are set to reasonable default values that should
allow you to make a phone call\&. These defaults are determined in the
following way: 
.TP 
1
A set of default parameters is
compiled into the code\&. These will be used if no other parameters are
found\&.
.TP 
2
The file "gua\&.cfg" may be
found in the VOCAL allinone install directory (typically
/usr/local/vocal/etc)\&. If that file is present, it will override all
parameters from the code\&.
.TP 
3
The file
"gua\&.cfg" in your HOME directory\&. Any parameters in this file take
precedence over all others\&.
.SH MAKING A CALL
Call in Progress
.PP
From the main screen, check to make sure you are registered\&. The
icon on the lower right of the screen will be a green check if you are
registered\&. Type the SIP uri or phone number of the phone you wish to call
in the dial entry field\&. Press Enter or click on the Talk button to
initiate the call\&.
.PP
As the call progresses, you will see the following status messages
at the bottom of the window: 
.TP 
TRYING
The
User Agent is trying to contact the callee
.TP 
RINGING
The
callee\&'s phone is ringing
.TP 
IN  CALL
The call is connected and you can talk\&.
.TP 
LOCAL  HANGUP
You terminated the call from your end\&.
.TP 
REMOTE  HANGUP
The person you were calling terminated the
call\&.
.SH CALL HISTORY
The dial entry field contains a drop-down list of all the numbers
you have called\&. You may select a number from this list or type a new one
into the field\&. To clear the list, select Tools/Clear History\&.
.SH VIEW MESSAGES
View Messages Window
.PP
You may view all of the SIP transaction messages generated from and
received by the User Agent\&. Open View/Messages to see these\&.
.SH GUA STARTUP
When you start gua, you will get a command-line prompt giving you
directions on how to proceed\&. Type \fBh\fR at any time
for help\&.
.PP
You must give the location of a configuration file on the command
line\&. A sample file called \fIsample-gua\&.cfg\fR is in the
gua source directory\&. Edit this file with a text editor\&. The following
sections on Basic and Advanced Configuration refer to GUI windows where
configuration parameters are entered\&. These parameters get written to a
file that has the same format as \fIsample-gua\&.cfg\fR\&.
