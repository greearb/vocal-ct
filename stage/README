Stage Tools

This directory contains staging tools for VOCAL.  The staging tools
are used to decide which files are needed to be copied to a VOCAL
installation, to copy those files, and to produce binary packages
(both tar.gz and RPM) from these file lists.

Files include:

	filelist.conf -- this contains a list of the files which are
	copied from elsewhere in the VOCAL tree to a binary install.

	version.conf -- the version of VOCAL for this release.  we
	should update this periodically

	rpmversion.conf -- the version of the RPM spec for the
	vocalbin spec file.

	vocalbin.spec.in -- the RPM spec file for a binary release of
	VOCAL.  the vocalbin.spec.in produces vocalbin.spec via a sed
	subsititution to produce vocalbin.spec, which produces a
	binary-only RPM, like a closed source product, by building the
	binaries using the traditional VOCAL process and then RPMizing
	these binaries, instead of building from source like a
	traditional RPM does.

	However, this fits better into the VOCAL process, and it's
	easier to get this sort of RPM right because you don't have to
	keep rebuilding VOCAL over and over and over.  vocalbin.

	vocal.spec -- this is an RPM spec file that follows the RPM
	philosophy and contains a tar.gz of VOCAL.  However, it
	doesn't work yet...

	stage/newstage.pl -- this is the script which copies the files
	over from the rest of the VOCAL tree to here.
