CDR Server
==========

usage: cdrserv [-d] [-v loglevel] pserver:6005 bkupPs:6005 xxxx

The CDR Server uses the CommandLine.hxx in the util directory
to get all of it's commandline parameters. Since it does
not use the sip stack, the SIP port can be set to any value.
eg. xxxx

To run the server with no provisioning server, set the environment
variable CDRCONFIGFILE to the config file. The cdr.cfg file contains
all supported fields.

All of the supported configuration data is contained and set in
the CdrConfig.hxx file.
Environment variables always override the provisioning data and
config file data.

The CdrBilling.cxx has 2 extra environment variables:
BILLING_FILE_LOCK_LIMIT   age limit of stale lock file before deleting
BILLING_ERROR_FILE_EXT    extension of billing error file, default
                          ".error"
