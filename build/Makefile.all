# the following macros set the following variables:


#  OSTYPE  -- this variable is the OS type of the target system.  By default
#             this is the OS of the host system

#  ARCH    -- this is the machine architecture of the target system.
#             By default this is the architecture of the host system.

#  LARCH   -- this is the "logical" architecture for the target system.
#             This is to let systems with different "architectures" but
#             in the same family be the same, e.g. IA32 for i386, i486, i586,
#             and i686.

#  ROOT    -- this is the location of the "root" of the file system.  It
#             requires that the BUILD macro be set to the path to the build
#             directory.
