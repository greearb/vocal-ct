INTRODUCTION
====================================================================

The focus of this Media Server is to consolidate all
of VOCAL's end-user messaging into one system.
The first version will be based off the current voicemail
server code.

After a stable media server is created, we can then focus
on creating different modules like controlling XML services,
Music-on-Hold, Intercom, Instant Messaging, Video Conferencing,
etc....

The sip agent of this project will revolve around the Cisco
7940/7960 phone.  After the server is stable and running
correctly with the Cisco phone, we then will start adding
support for agents.

==========================
== System Initial Setup ==
==========================

The Mailbox Administrator (vmadmin) listens on port 9024
and uses a fsvm server on port 5210 with uavm's 5270-5279.
This is the default configuration and will be easier to modify
in the future.

Here is a small run-down of how the player works:

<initial connection>
===Play Prompt:  LOGIN
<user enters 4 digit ext & presses '#'
===Play Prompt:  PASSWORD
<user enters password & presses '#'

If login is successful:
===Play Prompt: HEADER
===Play Prompt: MAINMENU

If login is unseccessful:
===Play Prompt:  LOGININCORRECT
**REPEAT LOGIN PROCEDURE**

The REPEAT loop will go one for 3 login attempts.
If the user doesn't correctly login within 3 attempts,
the session is terminated.


=====================
== MENU NAVIGATION ==
=====================

After Login is successful and after Prompts HEADER &
MAINMENU play, the user is given navigational options:

2 --	Plays current Message
3 --	Plays Time & Date message was received <not implemented yet>
4 --	Goes to previous message & automatically plays it
5 --	Forwards message to another mailbox <not implemented yet>
6 --	Goes to next message & automatically plays it
7 --	Restore Current Deleted Message
8 --	Delete Current Message
9 --	Enter Administration Menu <not implemented yet>
