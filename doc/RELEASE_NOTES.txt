in PSTN calls.

Known Bugs:

682: Call Blocking Feature should allow local calls if dailed with
     full E164 number.
     This is a limitation of the Long Distant Call Blocking Feature
     server using the pattern 1+ to determine if a call is a long
     distant call or not. In order to allow some 1+ dialing calls
     to go through, the Java provisioning GUI code, generated CPL
     and feature server code need to be modified.
