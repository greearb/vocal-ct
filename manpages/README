I've begun writing our man pages in Docbook SGML, version 4.1.  For
more information, please see

	http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook-x.html

the pages we're writing for this purpose are of type refentry.  an
example is pserver.sgml. 

This is not XML, but it should be possible to convert it in the
future, as long as we do the following:

	Always close tags with corresponding end-tags.

	Wrong:	
		<para> The paragraph....
		<para> Second paragraph....

	Right:
		<para>The paragraph.......</para>
		<para>Second paragraph....</para>
    
      	Write all elements and attributes in lowercase. example:

	Wrong:
		<RefEntity>

	Right:
		<refentity>


	Quote all attributes. 

	Wrong:
		<refentity id=pserver>
		....

	Right:
		<refentity id="pserver">
		....

I have installed a number of packages to get docbook to man page
conversion working.  the package is part of redhat -- it's
docbook-utils-0.6-13 .

I had some trouble in setting up my xemacs to properly parse my
docbook sgml stuff, so i used 

	http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4/psgml-mode.html

to sort these things out.

=============================================================
sipset
-------
sipset.sgml is used to generate both a manpage and an html page
for inclusion on vovida.org. The web page uses images from the
images directory.

To regenerate the manpage, use generate.pl sipset.sgml

Or, to do it by hand:
docbook2man -o generated_man sipset.sgml

To regenerate the html page, type
docbook2html -o generated_html sipset.sgml
mv generated_html/index.html generated_html/sipset.html

The man page should be copied to /usr/local/vocal/bin/man/man1.
The html page and images must be manually copied to the vovida.org website.
