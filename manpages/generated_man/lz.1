and stress testing\&. You can test SIP calls originating from ElGee against
a SIP proxy server or any other SIP UAS\&.

ElGee supports HTTP-Basic, HTTP-Digest and SIP-CHAP based
authentication\&. both WWW-Authenticate and Proxy-Authenticate based
challenges can be authenticated for INVITEs and REGISTERs\&.

.TP 0.2i
•
Originating
.TP 0.2i
•
Registration
.TP 0.2i
•
Terminating
.PP
These running modes allow for stress load generation to simulate
large number of SIP clients\&.
.SS UDP & TCP
ElGee supports both transport protocols\&. for
originating/registration mode, sample message should specify the
transport param in headers, while in terminating mode it listens for
both\&. you can use ElGee more flexibly by using a config file\&. see the
