b2bua    \- SIP based Back to Back User Agent\&.

.SH DESCRIPTION
B2bUa is basically two UAs working back-to-back and thus controlling
the calls going through it\&. Unlike a SIP proxy, a b2bua will take an
incoming call, modify it and present it in other form to final
destination\&. B2bUa is in the call-signalling-path all the times\&. There are
numerous applications in which b2bUa can be used either as a media
negotiator or simply supervising the calls between two parties\&. The
software provides a basic framework for B2Bua and we have added a prepaid
billing application on top of that framework\&.
.PP
The B2bUa can be confgured either by using the file b2bConfig\&.xml or
using provisioning system\&. If the provisioning system is used, the
pserver_host:port and backup_pserver_host:port must be supplied\&.

.SH EXAMPLE
Example scenario:
.PP
.nf
  UA1  <----------->  B2BUA   <----> UA2
192\&.168\&.1\&.0          192\&.168\&.1\&.1     192\&.168\&.1\&.2
.fi

.PP
Configuration you need:
.TP 
1
If using VOCAL UA, the Proxy_Server line in configuration file
should point to 192\&.168\&.1\&.1\&. For other UA\&'s make sure the procy
setting points to 192\&.168\&.1\&.1
.TP 
2
In B2bConfig\&.xml, Proxy_Server->Address should point to
192\&.168\&.1\&.2 and Proxy_server->Port should be the sip-port of the
UA2\&.
.TP 
3
To disable the authentication and billing, set
PrePaid->Billing->Option to "free"\&.
.TP 
4
When billing is enabled, set
RADIUS->Billing_Server->Address to the address of billing
server\&.
